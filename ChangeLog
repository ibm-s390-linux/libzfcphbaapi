	* Makefile.am: use libzfcphbaapi.la for linking, so that
	automake creates explicit dependency on libzfcphbaapi.la for
	zfcp_ping/zfcp_show in resulting Makefile.

	* Makefile.am: add subdir-objects to automake options, so that
	automake can find files in subdirectories, like fc_tools.

	* configure.in: remove obsolete macro `AC_HEADER_STDC' and
	replace obsolete macro `AC_LANG_C' with `AC_LANG([C])'.
